\chapter{Janus}
In this chapter, we will illustrate how our tool \LTLfToDFA presented in Chapter \ref{ch:ltlf2dfa} can be efficiently employed in the field of Business Process Modeling, with particular attention to Process Mining. First of all, we will formally describe the theoretical framework of declarative process mining. Then, in this context, we will thoroughly describe the implementation of the Janus algorithm \citep{cecconi2018interestingness} for computing the interestingness degree of traces.
